### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


I am a Coastal Climate Scientist with a multidisciplinary background bridging climate, environment and data science with strong emphasis on climate-driven offshore and coastal hazards. 

My research focus on understanding historical and climate change-driven coastal hazards, such as widespread flooding driven by ocean waves, sea level and storm surges. 

Strong background on quantification of climate change â€˜uncertaintyâ€™ to support adaption pathways!
